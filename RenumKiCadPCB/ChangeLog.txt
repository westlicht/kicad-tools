Change Log V0.100 to V0.101

Making under Linux reported warnings which were not reported when compiled on Windows Eclipse neon. 
I also noted a but in run time reporting if the program was aborted.

Neither of these issues impacted program function

V0.101 		Replaced 	"printf(ERRSTR)" with puts ( ERRSTR ) in ParseCommandLine because of compiler warning under Linux
  			Added		return( ERRINVALIDEXIT ); because of compiler warning under Linux
  			Moved		gettimeofday( ); from main() to ParseCommandLine and changed abort
			decision to ensure valid run time reported
